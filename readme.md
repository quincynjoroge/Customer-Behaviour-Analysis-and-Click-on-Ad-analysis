# Customer behaviour analysis- Clustering
## Overview
We will be using data collected from an E-Commerce site. E-commerce is the buying and selling of goods and services, or the transmitting of funds or data, over an electronic network, primarily the internet.

Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.

We are to perform Unsupervised Machine learning: Kmeans Clustering and Hierachical Clustering.

Our metric for success is: Distinction of customer groups and their differentiating characteristics.
