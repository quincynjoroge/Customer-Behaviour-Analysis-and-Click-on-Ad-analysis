## Specifying The Question
To assist the sales team in identifying characteristics of consumer groups, do cluster analysis on customer behavior data obtained by Kira Plastinina, a Russian company.

## Metrics of success
Distinction of customer groups and their differentiating characteristics.

## Understanding the context
We will be using data collected from an E-Commerce site. E-commerce is the buying and selling of goods and services, or the transmitting of funds or data, over an electronic network, primarily the internet.

Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.

## Recording the experimental design
- Loading the data
- Check the Data
- Perform Data Cleaning
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis  (Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate)
- Implement the Solution
- Conclusion

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Loading libraries
```{r}
# Importing the necessary R libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(corrplot)
library(caret)
library(readr)
library(BBmisc)
library(psych)
options(warn = -1)

library(grid)
theme_set(theme_bw())
options(warn = -1)

```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

### Loading data

```{r}
shop = read.csv("http://bit.ly/EcommerceCustomersDataset")
```

## Exploratory Analysis

### Checking the data

```{r}
# checking the head of our data
head(shop)
```
```{r}
# checking the tail of our data
tail(shop)
```
```{r}
# checking the structure of the data
str(shop)
```

The dataset consists of 10 numerical and 8 categorical attributes

```{r}
# checking the number of observations and features
dim(shop)
```

Our data set has 12330 observations and 18 variables.

### Tidying the data

```{r}
# Checking for missing values
colSums(is.na(shop))
```

There are missing values in the columns: Administrative, Administrative_Duration,Informationa,Informational_Duration,ProductRelated,ProductRelated_Duration,BounceRates,ExitRates.

Let's check whether the features (columns) and samples (rows) have more than 5% of the data missing using a  function.

```{r}
pMiss <- function(x){sum(is.na(x))/length(x)*100}
apply(shop,2,pMiss)
apply(shop,1,pMiss)
```

The columns have more than 5% of missing data, we will still drop the rows as they are just 14 and our data has 12330 rows.

```{r}
# Omitting missing values
shop = na.omit(shop)

# Checking for missing values

colSums(is.na(shop))

# Check for number of remaining columns
print("The number of rows is:",quote=FALSE)
nrow(shop)
```

The missing values have been omitted and we now have 12316 observations which is enough for our analysis.

```{r}
# Checking for duplicates
duplicates <- shop[duplicated(shop),]
dim(duplicates)
```

There are 117 duplicates rows. We will remove the duplicates so as to have reliable data.

```{r}
# removing duplicates
shop <- shop[!duplicated(shop),]
dim(shop)
```

We now have 12199 observations and 18 variables.Our data set seems to still be enough for the analysis.

```{r}
# Check for unique values in month and visitor type columns
unique(shop$Month);
unique(shop$VisitorType);
```

- The unique values seem okay.

- The visitor type has 3 unique values; Returning visitor, New visitor and other.

- The months;Jan and April have no record.

#### There appears to be anomalies in the ProductRelated_Duration, Administrative_Duration and Informational_Duration columns with some observations having a value of -1. Duration cannot be negative.

```{r}
# Check the number of records with this anomaly

anomaly <- shop %>% select(c(Administrative_Duration, Administrative, Informational_Duration, Informational, ProductRelated_Duration, ProductRelated)) %>% filter(Administrative_Duration == -1 | Informational_Duration == -1 | ProductRelated_Duration == -1)

anomaly
```

There are 33 records with this anomaly. We will drop this records.

```{r}
# Dropping the 33 records
shop <- shop %>% filter(Administrative_Duration != -1, Informational_Duration != -1, ProductRelated_Duration != 1)
```

```{r}
# checking the remaining observations in our data
dim(shop)
```

Our data has 12164 observations now. This is still good for our analysis.

```{r}
# Creating a  function to check for the number of outliers in each column

outlier_detector <- function(x){
  out <- boxplot.stats(x)$out
  return((length(out)/  12164)*100)
}
```

```{r}
# Get outlier count per column
sapply(shop[,c(1:9)], outlier_detector)
```

```{r}
# Plot boxplots of columns with high % of outliers
boxplot(shop$Informational, shop$Informational_Duration, shop$PageValues,
main = "Columns with high values of outliers",
names = c("Informational", "Informational_Duration", "Page Values"),
col = c("orange","blue"),
border = "brown",
notch = TRUE)
```

- All outliers are found above the third quantile, implying that they are all found in the higher ranges of the above variables. Given the nature of the data, it's quite possible for customers to spend extended periods of time on informational pages or browsing pages containing high-value items. As a result, we will keep the outliers.

- The other outliers will not be removed because they may reveal information about certain special days or consumers.

### Univariate Analysis

When using univariate approaches, you just look at one variable at a time.

The following are examples of univariate analysis:

- Mean, Median, and Mode are three measures of central tendancy.

- Dispersion measures include the minimum, maximum, range, quartiles, variance, and standard deviation.

- Other factors to consider are skewness and kurtosis.

- Histogram, Box plots, Bar plots, and Kernel density plots are examples of univariate graphs.

```{r}
# checking the summary statistics of each column
summary(shop)
```

The method describe() gives more measures of dispersion compared to the summary()

The describe() function which is part of the Hmisc package displays the following additional statistics:

- Number of rows
- Standard deviation
- Trimmed mean
- Mean absolute deviation
- Skewness
- Kurtosis
- Standard error

```{r}
# describing our columns
describe(shop)
```
Informational Duration, ProductRelated Duration, and PageValues are the most positively skewed variables, having high kurtosis values.



```{r}
# Frequency distribution of the categorical variables
sapply(shop[, c(11:18)], table)
```




```{r}
# Creating histogram plots to visually view the categorical variables
#par(mfrow=c(4,1))
for(i in 11:18) {
	counts <- table(shop[,i])
	name <- names(shop)[i]
	barplot(counts, main=name, col = heat.colors(20))}
```

- Months with the highest activity are May, November, March and December.

- Most visitors have a type 2 operating system followed by type 3 and 1.

- Most visitors have a type 2 browser.

- Most visitors to the site are located in region 1 and 3.

- Most of the traffic to the website is of type 2 and 1

- Visitors to the site are mostly returning visitors.

- Most of the traffic happens on weekdays rather than on weekends.

- Most visits to the site do not earn revenue.

### Bivariate Analysis

Two variables are analyzed to see if there is a relationship between them.

```{r}
# Let's plot scatter plots
plot(Administrative_Duration ~ Informational_Duration, dat = shop, 
      col = "blue",
      main = "Admin vs Information Scatter Plot")
```

The Administration duration and Information duration seem to have a weak relationship.

```{r}
# Let's plot scatter plots
plot(BounceRates ~ ExitRates, dat = shop, 
      col = "blue",
      main = "BounceRates vs ExitRates Scatter Plot")
```

There is a high positive correlation between Bounce and exit rates. This shows that users who bounce from one page to another are most likely to exit the site quicker.

```{r}
# Number of visits to product related pages per month
product_stats <- shop %>% select(ProductRelated, ProductRelated_Duration, Month)%>%group_by(Month)%>% summarise_all(mean)
product_stats[order(product_stats$ProductRelated, decreasing = TRUE),]
```


It seems that there is more activity in November as it  has the highest product related visits and the product related duration is high as well.

```{r}
# Getting the  bounce rates and exit rates among visitor groups
visitor <- shop %>% select(VisitorType, ExitRates, BounceRates)%>% group_by(VisitorType)%>%summarise_all(mean) 

visitor
```

Visitors of type other have a higher ExitRate and BounceRates followed by ReturningVisitors.

```{r}
# Creating a plot to show the ExitRate and BounceRatesin relation to the traffic type.
traffic <- shop %>% select(TrafficType, ExitRates, BounceRates)%>% group_by(TrafficType)%>% summarise_all(mean)
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
ggplot(traffic, aes(x=TrafficType, y = ExitRates))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill="peachpuff2")
ggplot(traffic, aes(x=TrafficType, y = BounceRates))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill="peachpuff2")
```

The traffic types 15 and 17 have the highest Exit and Bounce Rates.

```{r}
# Creating a plot to show the Administrative, ProductRelated and Informational relation to the traffic type.
traffic_page<- shop %>% select(TrafficType, Administrative,Informational,ProductRelated)%>% group_by(TrafficType)%>% summarise_all(mean)
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
ggplot(traffic_page, aes(x=TrafficType, y = Administrative))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill="lightblue")
ggplot(traffic_page, aes(x=TrafficType, y = Informational))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill="lightblue")
ggplot(traffic_page, aes(x=TrafficType, y = ProductRelated))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill="lightblue")
```

```{r}
# Stacked bar chart: Visitor Type vs Month
shop %>%
    ggplot(aes(Month)) +
    geom_bar(aes(fill = VisitorType))+
    labs(title = "Visitor Type by Month")
```

- Feb and June are the least busy months.

- May, Nov, March, and December are the busy months.

- During these months there is a higher number of new visitors. This can be leveraged by the company to create advertisements that will attract the new users to register to the site.

- **Other** customer shops in November and December. 

```{r}
# Stacked bar chart: Revenue vs Day Type
shop %>%
    ggplot(aes(Revenue)) +
    geom_bar(aes(fill = Weekend))+
    labs(title = "Revenue by Day Type")
```

- Our data is imbalanced.

- Most of the data indicates that a client's visit to the page did not result in income for the company, i.e. the customer did not make a purchase.

- Of the remaining data, the company made revenue mostly during the weekdays.

### Multivariate Analysis

Three or more variables are analyzed to derive conclusions and find relationships between them.

```{r}
# calculating correlations and plotting a correlation plot
corrplot(corr = cor(shop[, c(1:9)]), method = "number", type = "upper", order = "hclust", tl.col = "black", tl.cex = 0.6)

```

There is a high correlation between bounce rates and exit rates.

## Implementing the solution

### Encoding our categorical variables

```{r}
# One hot encoding of the factor/categorical variables.

dummy_shop = dummyVars(" ~ .", data = shop)

df = data.frame(predict(dummy_shop, newdata = shop))
```

```{r}
# checking the data types
sapply(df, class)
```

```{r}
glimpse(df)
```

```{r}
# We will remove the Revenue column it is the class label, we will store it in another variable
df_copy <- df[, -c(30:31)]
df.class<- shop[, "Revenue"]

df_copy_copy <- df[, -c(30,31)]
```

```{r}

# Previewing the dataset with dummies
head(df_copy)
```

Normalizing or Scaling the data. Lets see which gives the best:
This is important to ensure that no particular attribute has more impact on clustering algorithm than others.

```{r}
# scaling
df_scaled <- scale(df_copy)
# check the output
summary(df_scaled)
```

Some attributes continue to have high values when compared to others.
The data is scaled to have a mean of 0 as a result of the scaling.

```{r}
# Lets normalize the data and see if the results change.
# Normalize
df_norm <- as.data.frame(apply(df_copy, 2, function(x) (x - min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))))
# summary of normalized data
summary(df_norm)
```

We have a maximum value of 1 and minimum value of 0s and mean of close to zero in all attributes.
We will use the Normalized data set for clustering.

```{r}
library(cluster)    # clustering algorithms
library(factoextra) # clustering algorithms & visualization
```

### KMeans Clustering

```{r}
# Using Elbow plot  method, Searching for the optimal number of clusters
fviz_nbclust(df_norm, kmeans, method = "wss") +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 4, linetype = 2)+
  labs(subtitle = "Elbow plot")

```

4 is the number of optimal clusters, we can use to  perform the final analysis and extract the results using 4 clusters.

```{r}
# Compute k-means clustering with k = 4
set.seed(123)
final <- kmeans(df_norm, 4, nstart = 25)
print(final)
```

```{r}
# Previewing the number of records in each cluster

final$size
```

cluster 1 has 2607 records

cluster 2: 4515 records

cluster 3: 2189 records

cluster 4: 2853 records

```{r}
# visualize the results
fviz_cluster(final, data = df)
```


The visualization isn't really clear.


```{r}
# Plotting two variables to see how their data points have been distributed in the cluster
# Product Related, vs Product Related Duration

plot(df_norm[, 5:6], col = final$cluster)
```

Extract the clusters and add to our initial data to do some descriptive statistics at the cluster level

```{r}
shop %>%
  mutate(Cluster = final$cluster) %>%
  group_by(Cluster) %>%
  summarise_all("mean")
```


### Hierachical Clustering

```{r}
# First we use the dist() to compute the Euclidean distance between observation points
shop_dist = dist(df_norm, method = "euclidean")

# Set the hclust() dissimilarity matrix
# We then apply hierarchical clustering using the Ward's method
shop_hc = hclust(shop_dist, method = "ward.D2")

# Plot the obtained dendrogram
plot(shop_hc, cex = 0.6, hang = -1)
```

```{r}
# cutting the clusters into 4 groups
group<-cutree(shop_hc,k=4)
# viewing the clustered groups
table(group)
```

```{r}
# creating a table
hclust<-dplyr::mutate(shop,clusters=group)
head(hclust)
```

One potential disadvantage of K-means clustering is that it requires us to pre-specify the number of clusters. Hierarchical clustering is an alternative approach which does not require that we commit to a particular choice of clusters. Hierarchical clustering has an added advantage over K-means clustering in that it results in an attractive tree-based representation of the observations, called a dendrogram. 

However from the above, The Kmeans clustering seems to have done better as compared to the hierarchical cluster method.


## Conclusion

- Informational Duration, ProductRelated Duration, and PageValues are the most positively skewed variables, having high kurtosis values.

- Months with the highest activity are May, November, March and December. The company should consider psudhing more adverts or offers to increase sales on these months.

- Most visitors have a type 2 operating system followed by type 3 and 1. It would be better if we would further explore what these os are.

- Most visitors have a type 2 browser.

- Most visitors to the site are located in region 1 and 3. The company should also focus more on these two regions in order to drive more sales and traffic to their site.

- Most of the traffic to the website is of type 2 and 1.

- Visitors to the site are mostly returning visitors.

- Most of the traffic happens on weekdays rather than on weekends. Most adverts should be running on weekdays as wel as offers.

- Most visits to the site do not earn revenue. We would further need to explore on this and get a reason as to why people do not purchase products.

- There is a high positive correlation between Bounce and exit rates. This shows that users who bounce from one page to another are most likely to exit the site quicker.

- It seems that there is more activity in November as it  has the highest product related visits and the product related duration is high as well.

- Visitors of type other have a higher ExitRate and BounceRates followed by ReturningVisitors.

-The traffic types 15 and 17 have the highest Exit and Bounce Rates.

- During these months there is a higher number of new visitors. This can be leveraged by the company to create advertisements that will attract the new users to register to the site.

- **Other** customer shops in November and December. 

- Most of the data indicates that a client's visit to the page did not result in income for the company, i.e. the customer did not make a purchase.
